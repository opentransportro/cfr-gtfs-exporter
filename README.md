# Romanian Railways GTFS exporter
This ruby utility converts public transport data from data.gov.ro into [GTFS](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference) files. The datasource is published by the romanian railways operators at this address: https://data.gov.ro/organization/sc-informatica-feroviara-sa

## Usage
**TLDR;** If you are in a hurry just grab the gtfs files located in [gtfs-out](https://github.com/vasile/data.gov.ro-gtfs-exporter/tree/master/gtfs-out) folder of this repo. I am generating these files on a regular basis, once there is a new update from [data.gov.ro](http://data.gov.ro)

Please link back to this page if you are using this utility or the generated files in your projects. **Thanks!**.

### Steps
* clone/download this repo
* download latest XML files from [data.gov.ro](https://data.gov.ro/organization/sc-informatica-feroviara-sa) into `data.gov.ro` folder
* if needed install Nokogiri Ruby gem: `$ (sudo) gem install nokogiri`
* run `$ ruby parse.rb`
* in few seconds the `gtfs-out` folder is populated with required GTFS files
